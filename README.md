# GreenhouseSystem
This is a flask app that is built to run my home greenhouse system that is locally hosted on a raspberry pi zero WH and powered from solar panels.

It runs while there is enough electricity. 

# Info
- The code may be clunky (This was designed/built as I went along)
- A lot of modifications will be needed if you want to use this. (I have not designed this to be shared)
